README GFF3 FILES FOR TAIR10

*** TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gff ***

GFF file containing features (mRNA, exon, CDS,...) of ALL TAIR10 genes ,including non-protein coding genes(pseudogenes,
RNA genes, transposable element genes)



*** TAIR10_GFF3_genes_transposons.gff ***

GFF file containing features (mRNA, exon, CDS,...) of ALL TAIR10 genes ,including TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS and all non-protein coding genes (pseudogenes,
RNA genes, transposable element genes)


*** TAIR10_unconfirmed_exons.gff***

GFF file containing exons of TAIR10 genes that are not completely confirmed by expression evidence or VISTA sequence similarity 
(i.e. it only displays exons for which at least one splice-junction is NOT confirmed experimentally). Documentation on how we generated 
the score (f.ex. E4) for each exon can be found here: ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/Genes/Gene_Confidence.pdf
